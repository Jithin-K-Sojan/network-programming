This is an implementation of two specific protocols defined according to the problem details given for an assignment in Computer Networks.

The first implementation is that of a file transfer over two channels, both TCP connections. Look at the README inside the MultiChannelTCP directory for information regarding how to run it and other details.

The second implementation is that of a file transfer over two channels, both containing one relay each. Each connection is a UDP connection. Selective Repeat is the protocol used to implement reliability. Look at the README inside the SelectiveRepeatUDP directory for information on how to run it and other details.
